2017 has been a very exciting year so far. I started working as a data scientist at [SeerNet Technologies](deepaffects.com). 
SeerNet is an AI startup working on building an AI engine for [Affective Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_computing).

While we are working on emotion classification task from text we came across a task of finding emotion intensity 
from tweets [here](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/EmotionIntensity-SharedTask.html).
I wanted to give it a try, but we don't have a lot of time as the tasks end in a week or two and
we are busy working on other stuff in parallel. So, I quickly went through the
[baseline](https://github.com/felipebravom/EmoInt) and read few papers on the related task. 
Even though the baseline system is good I had a hard time using and iterating through model development because
I'm not familiar with [weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) and it command line usage.
 
So, I quickly implemented a high level framework for doing basic things like pre-processing, 
feature extraction and model building. 
You can have a look at our EmoInt repository [here](https://github.com/SEERNET/EmoInt).
Now that this is taken care of we developed various models and created ensembles of best performing models as our final submission. Our submission got 3rd rank out of 23 submissions
at [WASSA 2017](http://optima.jrc.it/wassa2017/) 
[EmoInt](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/EmotionIntensity-SharedTask.html) shared task. If you are interested, please have a look at our paper
[Seernet at EmoInt-2017: Tweet Emotion Intensity Estimator](http://aclweb.org/anthology/W17-5228).
 
[WASSA 2017](http://optima.jrc.it/wassa2017/) workshop is held in conjunction with [EMNLP 2017](http://emnlp2017.net/) 
and this year EMNLP took place in Copenhagen, Denmark. This was my first international trip so I was so excited. 
I got a chance to meet with and attended talks by many leading researchers in the field. 
Once the conference got over we went around in Denmark visiting Nyborg and Aarhus.

Here are some pics from the visit.
